title: Metro Card UI
summary: The introduction of ‘metro cards’ on rail networks across the world have made travel much easier, but that does not mean purchasing or topping-up the card is simple. For this exercise, redesign the workflow for somebody either buying or topping up a metro card while in a metro station anywhere around the globe. Keep in mind that this is likely a touch interface on a proprietary screen in a metro station.

The introduction of ‘metro cards’ on rail networks across the world have made travel much easier, but that does not mean purchasing or topping-up the card is simple. For this exercise, redesign the workflow for somebody either buying or topping up a metro card while in a metro station anywhere around the globe. Keep in mind that this is likely a touch interface on a proprietary screen in a metro station.

Further things to consider are:

* This should be mass-market and usable by people from any background or major language (not just English).
* Differing contrasts for dimly- or brightly-lit environments.
* People might be in a rush.

For bonus points, use the design language of a rail network local to you.

## Features

The application could include:

* Multiple languages.
* Multiple forms of payment.
* Purchasing a card.
* Checking remaining credit.

Keep in mind that these are not the only features that might be required, and you should use your initiative to ensure a usable and interesting experience.

##Please Prioritize

* Good usability.
* Appropriate aesthetics for the demographic, tone, mobile/touch paradigms, etc.
* Insight into your process, including any sketches, brainstorms, notes, wireframes, and assumptions on the product.

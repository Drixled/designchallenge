As security and privacy become more important, as does two-factor authentication. This exercise is to demonstrate how a designer might introduce two-factor authentication into an iOS app and encourage the user to set it up.

Please propose a design for how to encourage this and how to make it a secure and useful experience for the user, keeping in mind that they might lose their phone or backup codes, and that email resets are not totally secure.

## Features

* Encourage the user to set up two-factor authentication.
* Signing in with two-factor authentication.
* Resetting password with two-factor authentication.
* Recovering a blocked account with two-factor authentication and a lost phone.

Keep in mind that these are not the only features that might be required, and you should use your initiative to ensure a usable experience.

## Please Prioritize

* Good usability.
* Appropriate aesthetics for the demographic, tone, mobile/touch paradigms, etc.
* Insight into your process, including any sketches, brainstorms, notes, wireframes, and assumptions on the product.

This exercise is to design an application that can quickly split a check at a restaurant. The app should consider itemized bills, equal splits, and could also provide suggestions for tipping.

This application is intended for a broad audience, and you should consider that the people using this application might be in a rush, or may have been drinking alcohol with their meal.

Please propose a design for the default interface and the output, keeping in mind the simplicity required for an otherwise complex task.

## Features

* A way to input the check and split it either per person, itemized, or evenly.
* Tipping suggestions.

Keep in mind that these are not the only features that might be required, and you should use your initiative to ensure a usable experience.

## Please Prioritize

* Good usability.
* Appropriate aesthetics for the demographic, tone, mobile/touch paradigms, etc.
* Insight into your process, including any sketches, brainstorms, notes, wireframes, and assumptions on the product.

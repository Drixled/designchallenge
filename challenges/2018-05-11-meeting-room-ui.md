---

This exercise is to design a user interface on a small or large screen to let someone know whether a meeting room is free, how long for, and allow the person to book on the spot if necessary.

This application is intended for use by anybody who might need a meeting room in a large office. You should consider that the people requiring the room might need it urgently, there may already be people in the room, they might only need it for 10-15 minutes, and that there might be more than one meeting room in the building.

Please propose a design for the user interface and the flow for booking the room, with a maximum of three screens.

## Features

* A way to see the availability or unavailibility of the room.
* Booking the room with some context around what that room is.
* Availability of other rooms on the premises.

Keep in mind that these are not the only features that might be required, and you should use your initiative to ensure a usable experience.

## Please Prioritize

* Good usability.
* Appropriate aesthetics for the demographic, tone, mobile/touch paradigms, etc.
* Insight into your process, including any sketches, brainstorms, notes, wireframes, and assumptions on the product.

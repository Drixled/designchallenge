Voting is complicated, yet hugely important. Create a method of allowing people to vote while considering things like security, fake voters, voting verification, and people who do not have IDs. Consider how the physical world could benefit the digital world.

Design a mobile app that provides an easy way for people to vote in local or national elections. Take into consideration voter verification and voter location.

Design 2-3 screens to communicate the flow (3 screens maximum).

## Features

* Voter and location verification.
* The voting process.
* Information about candidates.
* Confirming votes.

## Please Prioritize

* Good usability.
* Privacy reassurance.
* Consideration for first- and long-time users.
* Appropriate aesthetics for the demographic, tone, mobile/touch paradigms, etc.
* Insight into your process, including any sketches, brainstorms, notes, wireframes, and assumptions on the product.

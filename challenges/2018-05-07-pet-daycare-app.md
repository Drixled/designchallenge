This exercise is to design the workflow for finding someone to look after a pet, and to keep the pet owner updated with how their pet is doing while under care. The user should be able to find someone who is able to care for their pet in the best way possible, and the carer should be able to update the pet owner with information about the pet.

This application allows public searching for profiles and should allow for private communication between individuals, it should reassure the owners that they are finding trusted carers for their pet. The app should appeal to pet owners and be easy to use.

Please propose a design for finding a pet and the notification for receiving an update about your pet.

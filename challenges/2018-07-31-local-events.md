title: Local Events App
summary: Many people want to leave popular social networks but are concerned leaving would mean no longer being notified about local events. Imagine an experience which allowed users to create, share, attend, or be notified about certain events. Keep in mind that people may have different tests or some events may not be of interest to them, and that the creator may be a business.

Many people want to leave popular social networks but are concerned leaving would mean no longer being notified about local events. Imagine an experience which allowed users to create, share, attend, or be notified about certain events. Keep in mind that people may have different tests or some events may not be of interest to them, and that the creator may be a business.

Decide whether you would like to design the event creator or event attendee experience and design the ideal workflow, in particular demonstrating your understanding of what information is important for these events, and how people might find them:

1. Where is it?
2. How much does it cost?
3. What time should I arrive?
4. Will there be parking?
5. Anything else should I know?

Design a maximum of 2-4 screens for either web or mobile, providing as much background thinking as you can.

## Features

The application could include:

* Taste profiles.
* Searching for events.
* Inviting friends to events.
* Useful notifications about events.
* Event reminders.

Keep in mind that these are not the only features that might be required, and you should use your initiative to ensure a usable and interesting experience.

##Please Prioritize

* Good usability.
* Appropriate aesthetics for the demographic, tone, mobile/touch paradigms, etc.
* Insight into your process, including any sketches, brainstorms, notes, wireframes, and assumptions on the product.

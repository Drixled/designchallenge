title: The Perfect Coffee App
summary: Grinding and brewing coffee makes for the freshest, tastiest brews, yet it’s sometimes difficult to know the exact amount of coffee to use for a pourover, or the precise grind you need to for a french press.

Grinding and brewing coffee makes for the freshest, tastiest brews, yet it’s sometimes difficult to know the exact amount of coffee to use for a pourover, or the precise grind you need to for a french press. Design an app that allows the user to search for a specific coffee roaster and the recommended weight, grind, and brewing technique for that particular bean.

Propose a design for someone who is new to grinding and brewing their own coffee, allowing them to find their coffee, pick the intended brewing method, and walking them through the process (although this doesn’t need to be detailed in the challenge).

Design a flow on iOS or Android, keeping in mind the intended audience for this application.

## Features

The application could include:

* Search for a particular kind of coffee.
* Taste notes for a specific coffee.
* Timers.
* Filtering down to certain brews.
* Step-by-step guides.
* Weight conversions.

Keep in mind that these are not the only features that might be required, and you should use your initiative to ensure a usable and interesting experience.

## Please Prioritize

* Good usability.
* Appropriate aesthetics for the demographic, tone, mobile/touch paradigms, etc.
* Insight into your process, including any sketches, brainstorms, notes, wireframes, and assumptions on the product.

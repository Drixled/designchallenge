Anglepoise has decided it wants to create a more compelling way for people to view, understand, and purchase their popular 1227 lamps.

Design a web-based product page or product list to encourage users to purchase the lamp. The description, price, and dimensions of the product should be highlighted, but think of compelling ways to get people to add the item to their basket.

If you need to design a second screen to communicate your ideas, please do, but 2 screens maximum.

## Please Prioritize

* Good usability.
* Consideration for first- and long-time users.
* Appropriate aesthetics for the demographic, tone, mobile/touch paradigms, etc.
* Insight into your process, including any sketches, brainstorms, notes, wireframes, and assumptions on the product.

title: Chat Application
summary: This exercise is to design the home screen for an iOS app based around “discussions” or chat rooms. The app has a number of predetermined “channels” based on topics such as cooking, science, and movies. Users can participate in or create new “discussions” to go within any of the channels (e.g. “What is the best kind of rice?” in the cooking channel).

This exercise is to design the home screen for an iOS app based around “discussions” or chat rooms. The app has a number of predetermined “channels” based on topics such as cooking, science, and movies. Users can participate in or create new “discussions” to go within any of the channels (e.g. “What is the best kind of rice?” in the cooking channel).

This app is a public app with public discussions and profiles, it is not intended for private messaging. The app should be broadly appealing and easy to use, not directed at a specific audience.

Please propose a design for the home screen while keeping in mind the apps overall structure and navigation. If you need to design a second screen to communicate your ideas, please do, but 2 screens maximum.

## Features
 
Navigation elements and features on the home screen could include but are not limited to:

* A feed of discussions.
* Notifications.
* Switching between and browsing channels.
* Create new discussions.
* Search.
* Filtering (e.g. ‘Popular Discussions’).
* Accessing profiles.

Keep in mind that I’m not attached to any specific features or combination of features. The solution doesn’t need to be complex, but should be well considered and geared towards providing a fun, simple user experience!

## Things I’m Looking Out For

These are the things I kind of want to see at the end!

* Good usability.
* Consideration for new and returning users. People will use this daily, but that doesn’t mean the user will be a veteran of the product.
* Appropriate aesthetics for demographic, tone, mobile/touch paradigms, etc.
* An insight into your process, any sketches, brainstorms, notes, wireframes, assumptions, etc.
* Bonus points if you do any interactive prototypes for this (e.g. Principle).

The final deliverable should be a Google or Dropbox Paper doc, website, InVision link, or presentation that I can access from my browser!

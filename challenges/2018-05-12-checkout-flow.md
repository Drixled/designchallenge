Converting site exploration to a sale is the most important aspect of e-commerce design and many users drop out during the checkout flow. This exercise is to create a checkout experience that encourages the user to go through with a full purchase.

Please imagine you are buying some t-shirt and denim jeans and design the flow from these being in the basket to a purchase confirmation. The aesthetic can be whatever is most appropriate for the style of clothing you prefer, but please note the brands down so this can be judged.

It is encouraged to perform some research or do some reading about the points in which users drop out of a flow and come up with solutions around that.

## Features

* Ensuring the right item is in the basket.
* Easy checkout flow.
* Billing and shipping.
* Easy credit card entry.
* Clear confirmation.

Keep in mind that these are not the only features that might be required, and you should use your initiative to ensure a usable experience.

## Please Prioritize

* Good usability.
* Appropriate aesthetics for the demographic, tone, mobile/touch paradigms, etc.
* Insight into your process, including any sketches, brainstorms, notes, wireframes, and assumptions on the product.
